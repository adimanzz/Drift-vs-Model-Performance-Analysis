# Drift-vs-Model-Performance-Analysis
A hands-on project that demonstrates how to detect data drift using Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) on time-evolving stock market data, and how this drift can impact machine learning model performance

Project Overview
1. Download historical stock data (e.g., Apple â€“ AAPL)
2. Calculate daily percentage change (pct_change)
3. Detect distributional shift (drift) between consecutive quarters using JSD
4. Visualize drift trends over time
5. Evaluate how drift affects predictive models
